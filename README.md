# Designing an Alert Correlation Engine using Mutual Information values  


The modern scaled digital transformation has made it difficult for the humans to keep up with the ephemeral state of IT workloads and processes although most of them has made significant investment on monitoring the application, infrastructure, and network. In case of any outage, these monitoring systems generate different alerts, but they do not generate them at the same time and not in sequence. It takes time for IT operations to find out the relation between these alerts and they end up creating too many tickets for different teams. We intend to correlate these alerts by collecting, analysing, and building a knowledge graph between them so that it can predict and group the future similar events that may affect availability and performance. We also want to improve the performance of the model through relevant feedback channel.
